Example 1:
Enter number of slave threads 
4
Enter max duration of request 
10
Enter producer interval 
5
Created request 1 of duration 4 at time 20:03:26 
Slave 0 accepted Request 1 of Duration 4 at time 20:03:26 
Slave 0 finished Request 1 at time 20:03:30 
Created request 2 of duration 7 at time 20:03:31 
Slave 1 accepted Request 2 of Duration 7 at time 20:03:31 
Created request 3 of duration 8 at time 20:03:36 
Slave 3 accepted Request 3 of Duration 8 at time 20:03:36 
Slave 1 finished Request 2 at time 20:03:38 
Created request 4 of duration 6 at time 20:03:41 
Slave 2 accepted Request 4 of Duration 6 at time 20:03:41 
Slave 3 finished Request 3 at time 20:03:44 
Created request 5 of duration 4 at time 20:03:46 
Slave 0 accepted Request 5 of Duration 4 at time 20:03:46 
Slave 2 finished Request 4 at time 20:03:47 
Slave 0 finished Request 5 at time 20:03:50 
Created request 6 of duration 6 at time 20:03:51 
Slave 1 accepted Request 6 of Duration 6 at time 20:03:51 
Created request 7 of duration 7 at time 20:03:56 
Slave 3 accepted Request 7 of Duration 7 at time 20:03:56 
Slave 1 finished Request 6 at time 20:03:57 

The above example demonstrates how the producer wakes a random consumer to process the request, and the varied durations of each request. 

Example 2:
Enter number of slave threads 
2
Enter max duration of request 
8
Enter producer interval 
1
Created request 1 of duration 8 at time 19:57:12

Slave 1 accepted Request 2 of Duration 7 at time 19:57:13

Created request 8 of duration 2 at time 19:57:19 
Slave 0 finished Request 1 at time 19:57:20 
Slave 0 accepted Request 3 of Duration 2 at time 19:57:20 
Slave 1 finished Request 2 at time 19:57:20 
Slave 1 accepted Request 2 of Duration 7 at time 19:57:20 
Created request 9 of duration 4 at time 19:57:20 
Created request 10 of duration 4 at time 19:57:21 
Slave 0 finished Request 3 at time 19:57:22 
Slave 0 accepted Request 9 of Duration 4 at time 19:57:22 
Created request 11 of duration 2 at time 19:57:22 
Created request 12 of duration 2 at time 19:57:23 
Created request 13 of duration 2 at time 19:57:24 
Created request 14 of duration 2 at time 19:57:25 
Slave 0 finished Request 9 at time 19:57:26 
Slave 0 accepted Request 11 of Duration 2 at time 19:57:26 
Created request 15 of duration 8 at time 19:57:26 
Slave 1 finished Request 2 at time 19:57:27 
Slave 1 accepted Request 15 of Duration 8 at time 19:57:27 
Created request 16 of duration 3 at time 19:57:27 
Slave 0 finished Request 11 at time 19:57:28 
Slave 0 accepted Request 16 of Duration 3 at time 19:57:28 
Created request 17 of duration 5 at time 19:57:28 
Created request 18 of duration 5 at time 19:57:29 
buffer full producer waiting 

The above example demonstrates the producer populating the buffer until it reaches maximum capacity, at which point the producer will wait until a consumer finishes a request.
