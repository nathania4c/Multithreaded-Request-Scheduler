# Multithreaded-Request-Scheduler Java & C++
For Master and N-Slave threads

# Part 1: Java
### How To Run
To compile the java file in terminal, type `javac part1.java`.

Then run the file by typing `java part1`.

The program will ask you for the number of slave threads, the maximum duration of each request, and the maximum interval at which the producer waits before making a new requests. Enter an integer for each prompt.

The program will run infinitely. Please press ctrl+c to terminate.

### Design
* The java program consists of 2 classes, a `Processor` class and a `Buffer` class. The `Processor` class includes a main function which is also a driver function that collects user input for the program and creates the consumer threads by creating instances of the `Buffer` class. The main function also directly calls the `producer()` function last.  
* `Buffer` objects created with an integer will be constructed to run the `run()` function which is the consumer function. 
* `Buffer` objects created with 2 integers will be constructed to initialize the class variables.
* Synchronization is achieved with 2 conditional variables `isFull, isEmpty` and a lock `lock` attached to the conditional variables, and the `synchronized` keyword. 
* Consumers sleep in the `isEmpty` queue if the queue is empty, woken by the producer when a request is generated.
* The producer sleeps in the `isFull` queue if the queue is full, woken by a consumer when a request is finished.
* The method `accessBufferData()` that is used to access the queue has the `synchronized` keyword which allows for synchronization provided by Java directly. Only 1 consumer or producer can access and modify the queue at any given time. 


## Part 2: C++
### How To Run
To compile in terminal, the c++ file by typing `g++ Part2.cpp -lpthread` then `./a.out`.

The program will ask you for the number of slave threads, the maximum duration of each request, and the maximum interval at which the producer waits before making a new requests. Enter an integer for each prompt.

The program will run infinitely. Please press ctrl+c to terminate.

### Design
* The program has a consumer and producer function, and a main function that creates the slave threads running the consumer function according to the number from user input, and a single additional thread to run the producer function. 
* Synchronization is achieved by having 4 mutexes (`buffer_mutex, used_slots_mutex, free_slots_mutex, running_mutex`) and 2 conditional variables (`used_slots_cond, free_slots_cond`). Each conditional variable is linked with its own mutex. The last mutex lock is used when accessing the request queue. 
* When the queue is empty consumers will wait in the conditional variable queue `used_slots_cond` and will be woken by the producer when a request is generated. 
* When the queue is full the producer will wait in the conditional variable queue `free_slots_cond` and will be woken by a consumer when it finishes a request. 
* Entering the critical section will require lock on the `running_mutex` 



## C++ experience
Working with C++ was rather challenging, compared to Java, because the syntax and features/requirements require more attention (ex. due to pointers and such). Thankfully, there are a plethora of online resources and documentations to get help from. However, aside from that, there wasn't much of a difference between working with Java and C++, since most of the challenge was in figuring out the algorithm.
