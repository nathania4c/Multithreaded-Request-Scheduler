# Multithreaded-Request-Scheduler C++
For Master and N-Slave threads

## How to run
Compile the c++ file by typing `g++ Part2.cpp -lpthread` then `./a.out`.

The terminal might give you a warning but it has no effect on the program's functionality. 

The program will ask you for the number of slave threads, the maximum duration of each request and the interval at which the producer makes new requests. Enter a number for each prompt.

The program runs infinitely, so to stop it press ctrl+c to terminate.



## C++ experience
Working with a different language is challenging because there are many syntax differences and different features/requirements. It was especially harder to go from Java to C++ than it is from C++ to Java because C++ requires more attention due to pointers and such. However, aside from that there isn't much of a difference between Java and C++, and there are a plethora of online resources and documentations to get help from.
