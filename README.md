# Multithreaded-Request-Scheduler C++
For Master and N-Slave threads

## How to run
Compile the c++ file by typing `g++ Part2.cpp -lpthread` then `./a.out`.

The program will ask you for the number of slave threads, the maximum duration of each request and the interval at which the producer makes new requests. Enter a number for each prompt.

The program runs infinitely, so to stop it press ctrl+c to terminate.

## C++ experience
Working with a different language is challenging because there are many syntax differences and different features/requirements. It was especially harder to go from Java to C++ than it is from C++ to Java because C++ requires more attention due to pointers and such. However, aside from that there isn't much of a difference between Java and C++, and there are a plethora of online resources and documentations to get help from.
