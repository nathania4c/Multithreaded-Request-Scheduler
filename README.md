# Multithreaded-Request-Scheduler C++
For Master and N-Slave threads

## How to run
Compile the c++ file by typing `g++ Part2.cpp -lpthread` then `./a.out`.

The terminal might give you a warning but it has no effect on the program's functionality. 

The program will ask you for the number of slave threads, the maximum duration of each request, and the maximum interval at which the producer waits before making a new requests. Enter an integer for each prompt.

The program will run infinitely. Please press ctrl+c to terminate.


## C++ experience
Working with C++ was rather challenging, compared to Java, because the syntax and features/requirements require more attention (ex. due to pointers and such). Thankfully, there are a plethora of online resources and documentations to get help from. However, aside from that, there wasn't much of a difference between working with Java and C++, since most of the challenge was in figuring out the algorithm.
